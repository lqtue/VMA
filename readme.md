## 1. Project Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To create the definitive, open-source, interactive platform for exploring the rich and layered history of Vietnam through historical cartography.

**Mission:** To develop a web-based, digital humanities resource that allows students, researchers, and the public to engage with Vietnam's past in a new way. We bridge the gap between historical inquiry and modern technology by digitizing historical maps, crafting compelling narratives, and integrating this data into modern geospatial platforms like OpenStreetMap (OSM).

## 2. Project Goals

- **Platform Development:** Build and maintain a user-friendly, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing web application accessible on all devices.
- **Historical Curation:** Research, collect, and digitize a comprehensive library of historical maps of Vietnam, beginning with an initial focus on Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.
- **Narrative Crafting:** Develop engaging, well-researched narratives that provide historical context to the maps and guide users through key moments in Vietnamese history.
- **Digital Preservation:** Georeference and trace historical maps to create "virtual copies" within OpenStreetMap, preserving this invaluable data for future research and analysis.
- **Community Building:** Foster a collaborative, interdisciplinary team of student volunteers, providing a platform for skill development and academic growth.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3, Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Mapping Libraries:** Leaflet.js
- **Data Parsing:** PapaParse
- **Geospatial Tools:** Atlas.co, QGIS, OpenStreetMap (JOSM, iD Editor)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 4. Project Phases

### Phase 1 (Current): Foundation & Core Content
- Develop and refine the core web application.
- Build a foundational dataset of maps and narratives for Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.
- Recruit and onboard the founding team of student volunteers.
- Establish workflows for research, data entry, and development.

### Phase 2 (Expansion):
- Expand geographical coverage to other significant regions and cities in Vietnam.
- Deepen the OpenStreetMap integration by completing virtual copies of the initial map set.
- Implement advanced features such as comparison sliders, search functionality, and user contribution tools.

## 5. Volunteer Opportunities

We are seeking passionate, intellectually curious students to join our founding team. No prior professional experience is required; we value a strong willingness to learn and a collaborative spirit above all. These are volunteer positions with flexible hours designed to complement your academic schedule.

### Available Roles

**Role Summary:** Become a digital historian for the project. You will uncover historical maps and weave the compelling narratives that connect them to Vietnam's past, forming the academic and storytelling core of our platform.

**Learning Opportunities:** Gain hands-on experience in primary source analysis, digital archiving, and historical writing for a public audience.

**Ideal Candidate:** Strong interest in Vietnamese history/culture, excellent research and writing skills, and meticulous attention to detail.

#### GIS Specialist & Digital Cartographer
**Role Summary:** Resurrect history in the digital age. You will use professional geospatial tools to transform static historical maps into dynamic, interactive digital layers.

**Learning Opportunities:** Receive training in highly sought-after GIS software (QGIS), understand cartographic principles, and contribute to a global, open-source data project (OSM).

**Ideal Candidate:** A curiosity for geography, urban studies, or data. A patient and detail-oriented mindset. No prior GIS experience is required.

#### Coder & Front-End Developer
**Role Summary:** Build the platform that brings our historical vision to life. You will work at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts, developing the front-end interface.

**Learning Opportunities:** Apply your coding skills to a real-world product, gain experience in a collaborative Git/GitHub environment, and develop a deeper understanding of front-end mapping libraries.

**Ideal Candidate:** A foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a passion for problem-solving.
