## What We're Building

We're creating an interactive website where anyone can explore Vietnam's rich history through old maps. Think of it as a digital museum that brings historical maps to life on your computer or phone.

### Our Vision
To build the best free, online platform for discovering Vietnam's past through historical maps that anyone can use and contribute to.

### Our Mission
We want to make Vietnamese history accessible to everyone - students, teachers, researchers, and curious people around the world. We're taking centuries-old paper maps and turning them into interactive digital experiences that tell the story of how Vietnam has changed over time.

## What We Want to Achieve

- **Build a User-Friendly Website:** Create a beautiful, easy-to-use website that works on computers, tablets, and phones
- **Collect Historical Maps:** Find, scan, and organize a complete collection of historical maps of Vietnam, starting with Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi
- **Tell Compelling Stories:** Write engaging stories that explain what these maps show and why they matter in Vietnamese history
- **Preserve History Digitally:** Convert old paper maps into digital formats that will last forever and can be studied by future generations
- **Build a Community:** Bring together students and volunteers who want to learn new skills while preserving Vietnamese heritage

## The Technology We Use (Simplified)

- **Website Building:** Standard web technologies (the same tools used to build most websites)
- **Interactive Maps:** Special software that makes maps you can zoom, click, and explore
- **Data Organization:** Tools to organize and display historical information
- **Map Creation:** Professional mapping software to create accurate digital versions of old maps
- **Collaboration:** Online tools that let our team work together from anywhere

## How We're Building This

### Phase 1 (What We're Doing Now)
- Building the main website
- Collecting and digitizing maps of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi
- Finding and training our first team of volunteers
- Setting up systems for research and teamwork

### Phase 2 (What's Next)
- Adding maps from other important Vietnamese cities and regions
- Creating more advanced features like comparing maps from different time periods
- Adding search tools so people can find specific places or time periods
- Letting users contribute their own historical knowledge

## Join Our Team - No Experience Required!

We're looking for enthusiastic students who want to learn new skills while contributing to something meaningful. These are volunteer positions with flexible schedules that work around your studies.

### Available Positions

#### Historical Researcher & Storyteller
